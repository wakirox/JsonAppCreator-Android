# Appkin: context for AI assistants

Appkin is an Android app that turns a JSON configuration into a native app. You write the configuration; the app validates it against the v3 schema and runs it. This document is the complete contract: use only what it describes.

## Output contract

Return the configuration as one valid JSON object, with no comments, Markdown fences or
prose inside or around it. When you can create a file, put the JSON in the file; a short
note beside it may say what you left out and why, such as an image you couldn't verify.

Every new configuration must begin with these root fields:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 3,
  "name": "Application name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "mainView": {
    "type": "layout",
    "views": []
  }
}
```

The optional root fields are `author`, `icon`, `changelog`, `debugMode`, `views`, and
`actions`.

## Generation rules

1. Use only the properties this document describes, with lowercase enum values exactly
   as written. The schema rejects unknown properties.
2. Make `mainView` an inline view unless it intentionally references a reusable root
   view. Put reusable screens in root `views` and reusable behaviour in root `actions`.
3. Reference a reusable view or action with `{ "ref": "id" }`, never `{ "id": "..." }`
   alone. Give every referenced definition a unique, non-empty `id`.
4. Give every action definition a complete `event`.
5. Trace the data at every node: a list's `itemView` gets one item, a `rest` event's
   `thenDo` gets the response, a form's action gets the submitted values, and a `show`
   event's view gets the current data.
6. Use `mapping` for a path to one value or array; use `${path}` to build text or a URL
   from values. Match the real data exactly, including case and nesting.
7. Every list needs an `itemView` and one source of items: `mapping` to an array of
   objects (in `data`, or in the `initData` response), or `stored` for objects saved on
   the phone (no `mapping`).
8. Use HTTPS. Never write a real API key, token, password or other secret into the
   JSON: write a placeholder of two underscores, an uppercase name and two underscores,
   such as `?api_key=__EXAMPLE_API_KEY__` or
   `"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer __EXAMPLE_TOKEN__" }`. Appkin asks the user for
   each value when the app opens, stores it encrypted and fills it into every request.
   Use one name per key.
9. Prefer a small working configuration over speculative or undocumented fields.
10. Before answering, check the JSON syntax and that every reference resolves to exactly
    one definition.
11. Open every image address before you use it, and keep only those that show the
    picture. Never build one from a name (a place's, a file's). If you can't open web
    pages, leave images out and say so in your note.

## Data-flow checklist

Before writing JSON, identify:

- The fixed data, if any, and the data saved on the phone (which collections)
- The exact shape of every REST response
- Which object is the current data when each action runs
- Which array, or which collection, each list shows
- Which values each form submits
- Which object each opened view receives

Then build the configuration in this order: reusable views, reusable actions and event
chains, the main view, references, and a final syntax and schema check.

## Supported language

Views:

- `layout`
- `text`
- `button`
- `image`
- `list`
- `form`
- `check` (a tick box for a true/false field; ticking it runs its action at once, usually `update`)

Events:

- `show`
- `rest`
- `alert`
- `calendar` (opens the phone's calendar app on a new event, for the user to save)
- `save` (saves the current data, such as a form's values, in a collection on the phone)
- `update` (changes a saved object, by default the one with the current data's `id`)
- `delete` (removes a saved object, or all that match `where`; put it behind an alert to ask first)
- `back` (closes the current screen, such as after a form saves an edit)
- `copy` (copies a text to the clipboard, to paste in a chat)
- `open` (hands a `https:`, `http:`, `geo:`, `tel:` or `mailto:` address to the browser,
  maps, the dialer or email; nothing else opens)
- `share` (opens the share sheet on a text)

Other enums:

- Orientations: `vertical`, `horizontal` (and `grid`, for lists only)
- Actions: `click`, `longclick`
- HTTP methods: `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`
- Text styles: `regular`, `italic`, `bold`
- Text formats: `plain`, `html`, `markdown`
- Text inputs: `plain`, `numeric`, `email`, `password`, `url`
- Form elements: `text`, `selector`, `date`, `time`, `checkbox`, `hidden`, `photos` (pick photos from the gallery, kept on the phone), `tags` (labels a stored list can filter on)

Do not invent support for PATCH, JavaScript expressions, conditions other than
`visibleIf`, databases beyond `save`, `update`, `delete` and `stored`, arbitrary native
components, or undocumented style properties.

## Common mistakes

### Text, buttons and images

- A button shows its `title` (or the value its `mapping` selects); its `label` is not
  displayed.
- A text view shows its `label` as a heading, then the `mapping` value or `title` under it
  as a quieter line. Use `textStyle` and `textSize` for emphasis, and `labelStyle` to style
  the label alone (`"labelStyle": "bold"`). For a value holding HTML, add
  `"format": "html"`; for longer text you write yourself (a description, tips),
  `"format": "markdown"` allows headings, **bold**, *italics*, lists and links. A web address
  written in a text view becomes a link.
- An image's `"scale": "fit"` shows the whole picture instead of cropping it.
- Sizes are numbers (dp and sp), not strings: `"size": { "height": 200 }`.
- Give every app an `icon`: one emoji that fits it, such as `"🏍️"` for a motorcycle guide.
  It is the app's icon on the home page and the phone's home screen.

### Lists and data

- A list's fixed items go in `data` on the list or a parent; a REST list uses `initData`.
  For an API with pages (a `skip`, `offset` or `page` parameter, or a "next" link), add
  `"nextPage": { "parameter": "skip", "step": 40 }` (the page size) or
  `"nextPage": { "urlFrom": "info.next" }` to `initData`. `"orientation": "grid"` with
  `"columns": 2` shows items side by side; `emptyText` says what an empty list means.
- Inside `itemView`, and in views opened from an item, mappings and `${...}` refer to that
  one item's fields, not to the whole response.
- Paths reach array items by index: `meals.0.strMeal`. When a response wraps one object in
  an array, open its view with a `show` event whose `mapping` is `"meals.0"`.
- `mapping` is a plain path such as `owner.name`; `${owner.name}` only builds text. A
  placeholder always starts with `$`: `${title}`, never `{title}`.
- Data is often incomplete. A text view with nothing to show isn't drawn, label included,
  and a missing `${...}` becomes empty text. To hide another view, such as a button that
  needs a field, use `"visibleIf": "field"` (shown when it has a value) or
  `"visibleIf": "!field"`. It is a path, never a comparison.
- An event's `data`, like an action's, replaces the current data it runs with; a form's
  submitted values still come first.

### Forms

- Form fields are `text`, `selector`, `date`, `time`, `checkbox`, `hidden`, `photos` and
  `tags`; there is no `input`, `dropdown` or `switch`. Dates are `dd/MM/yyyy`, times
  `HH:mm`. A selector option is a string or `{ "label": "Any type", "value": "" }`.
- To send something from the screen with a form, such as an item's id, use a `hidden`
  field: `{ "type": "hidden", "mapping": "id", "value": "${id}" }`.

### Saved on the phone

- For a list the user ticks off or edits, such as places to visit or things to pack, use a
  `stored` list with `initialItems`: the full objects, each with every field its views
  show and a `key`, plus `"unique": "key"`. The list saves them itself the first time, and
  later versions' new items are added without undoing ticks; never add a button that
  saves them. Tick with a `check` whose action is an `update` of that collection.
- Order a stored list with `"sort": [{ "by": "visited" }, { "by": "order" }]`: `false`
  comes before `true`. `order` lists values to put first, always as text
  (`["High", "Low"]`, `["false", "true"]`); `"descending": true` turns it round.

### Links and requests

- In a URL, Appkin percent-encodes what each `${...}` inserts: write `?q=${q}`, never
  encode a placeholder yourself. Fixed text is sent as written, so encode it
  (`type=Arms%20and%20Armor`). A query parameter that is only a placeholder
  (`&type=${type}`) is left out when the value is empty.
- Never invent or guess an address (images, `rest` URLs, web pages) or its parts (folders,
  file names, IDs, sizes): it almost never loads, or shows the wrong thing. Use addresses
  the user gives, fields of a REST response, or ones you opened and saw work; otherwise
  leave them out.
- For a request that can fail in a way the user should understand, add `onError` (its
  data has `error.message`).
- For a button that opens a page, a map, the dialer or email, use an `open` event.

### Structure

- An inline action needs both `id` and `event`; to reuse one, define it in the root
  `actions` and reference it with `{ "ref": "id" }`.
- A screen opened with `show` already has Back: don't add Back buttons or alerts that
  explain it. Its `title` names the screen.
- JSON has no comments and no trailing commas.

## Reference

Generated from the v3 JSON Schema. Unknown properties are rejected. **Required** properties are marked.

### Root object

Machine-readable contract for an Appkin v3 application. schemaVersion is optional for backward compatibility; new configurations should set it to 3.

- `schemaVersion`: always `3`. Configuration-language version. Optional only for compatibility with configurations created before schema versioning was introduced
- `name` **(required)**: text (not empty)
- `author`: text
- `debugMode`: `true` or `false`
- `version` **(required)**: text (not empty)
- `icon`: text. One emoji for the app's icon on the home page and the phone's home screen, such as "🏍️". Without it, the icon is the name's first letter
- `changelog`: text
- `mainView` **(required)**: a view (or `{ "ref": "id" }`)
- `views`: an array; each item is a view. Reusable view definitions. References are not valid in this registry
- `actions`: an array; each item is an action definition. Reusable action definitions. References are not valid in this registry

### Views

Every view has a `type`. Where a view is expected, `{ "ref": "id" }` may reference a view defined in the root `views` instead.

#### `layout`

- `id`: text (not empty)
- `action`: an action (or `{ "ref": "id" }`)
- `mapping`: text
- `data`: an object with any data
- `visibleIf`: text
- `orientation`: one of `"horizontal"`, `"vertical"`. How the child views are arranged; vertical by default
- `views` **(required)**: an array; each item is a view (or `{ "ref": "id" }`). The child views, in order

#### `text`

- `label`: text. First line of the text view, shown above the text
- `labelStyle`: one of `"regular"`, `"italic"`, `"bold"`. The label's own style, so a bold heading needn't make its text bold; without it the label looks like the text
- `format`: one of `"plain"`, `"html"`, `"markdown"`. plain (default); html: simple HTML in the text (<b>, <i>, <em>, <strong>, <u>, <br>, <p>, <a href>), such as a museum's descriptions; or markdown: headings (#), **bold**, *italics*, lists (- or 1.), quotes (>), `code` and [links](https://...), such as a description you write

- `action`: an action (or `{ "ref": "id" }`)
- `mapping`: text. Path of an image address in the current data
- `data`: an object with any data
- `visibleIf`: text
- `url`: text. Image address; may use ${field} placeholders
- `size`: a size, `{ "width": number, "height": number }` in dp
- `scale`: one of `"crop"`, `"fit"`. crop (default): the picture fills its space and its edges may be cut; fit: the whole picture shows, inside its space

#### `list`

- `swipeToEndIcon`: one of `"add"`, `"check"`, `"close"`, `"copy"`, `"delete"`, `"edit"`, `"email"`, `"favorite"`, `"info"`, `"open"`, `"phone"`, `"place"`, `"refresh"`, `"search"`, `"settings"`, `"share"`, `"star"`. The icon under an item swiped towards the end; check by default
- `mapping`: text. Path of the array of objects to show, in data or in the initData response
- `data`: an object with any data
- `visibleIf`: text
- `itemView` **(required)**: a view (or `{ "ref": "id" }`). The view repeated for each item; its mappings and placeholders refer to that item
- `initData`: a REST request, `{ "url": ..., "method": "get" | "post" }`. A REST request whose JSON response is the list's data
- `stored`: an object. Shows objects the app saved on the phone with a save event, instead of initData or data; mapping is not used

- `buttonTitle`: text. The submit button's text; Submit by default
- `formElements` **(required)**: an array; each item is a form field. The fields; each one puts its value under its mapping in the submitted object

#### `check`

A tick box, ticked when the data's true/false value at mapping is true. Ticking the box runs its action at once with that value turned over, so an update event saves it; a ticked title is struck through. Only the box ticks: a tap on the title reaches the list item.

- `id`: text (not empty)
- `action`: an action (or `{ "ref": "id" }`). Runs when the box is ticked or unticked, with the data where the value at mapping says so; usually an update event
- `mapping` **(required)**: text (not empty). The field holding true or false, such as "done"

#### `rest`

- `url` **(required)**: text (not empty). HTTPS address; may use ${field} placeholders from the current data

- `description`: text. Notes for the event; may use ${field} placeholders
- `mapping`: text
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `open`

Hands an address to another app on the phone: https or http opens the browser, geo: a map, tel: the dialer (nothing is called) and mailto: an email app. No other kinds of address are opened.

- `url` **(required)**: text. An https:, http:, geo:, tel: or mailto: address, or a placeholder holding one, such as ${url}; values placeholders insert are percent-encoded
- `mapping`: text. Path of the part of the current data the address is filled in from
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `share`

Opens the phone's share sheet on a text, for the user to send to any app.

- `photos`: text. Path of the photos to share with the text, such as "photos" (a photos field's list): they go as attachments, the text as their caption
- `mapping`: text. Path of the part of the current data the text is filled in from
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `save`

Saves the current data (a form's submitted values) on the phone as a new object of a collection; a list with stored shows the collection. Each object gets an id and createdAt (epoch milliseconds). A form saved this way starts empty, not filled in from the screen's data (only its hidden fields take that, such as an app's id), and empty again after each save.

- `collection` **(required)**: text (not empty). The collection to add to, such as "ideas"; each app has its own
- `fields`: an object. Values to add to the object; text may use ${field} placeholders from the data the form showed (the screen's, or a list row's), then from the submitted values, such as { "appId": "${id}" }
- `unique`: text. A field that tells saved objects apart, such as "key": saving an object with the same value there replaces the one already saved (keeping its id) instead of adding another
- `thenDo`: an event. The event to run next, with the saved object as data
- `mapping`: text. Path of the part of the current data to save
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `update`

Changes a saved object: the current data (a form's submitted values, or a ticked check's item) and fields replace its values. Its id and createdAt never change.

- `collection` **(required)**: text (not empty). The collection the object is in

- `fields`: an object. Values to set too; text may use ${field} placeholders, filled as in a save event
- `thenDo`: an event. The event to run next, with the changed object as data
- `mapping`: text. Path of the part of the current data to save
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `delete`

Removes saved objects: the one whose id is id (the current data's by default), or every one where matches. Put it behind an alert's thenDoOK to ask first.

- `collection` **(required)**: text (not empty). The collection to remove from
- `id`: text (not empty). The id of the object to remove; "${id}" (the current data's id) by default
- `where`: an object. Instead of id: removes every object whose fields have these values, with ${field} placeholders from the current data, such as { "appId": "${id}" }
- `thenDo`: an event. The event to run next, with the current data
- `mapping`: text. Path of the part of the current data the id or where is filled in from
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `back`

Closes the current screen and goes back to the one that opened it, as the phone's Back does; such as after saving an edit.

- `mapping`: text
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `copy`

Copies a text to the clipboard, to paste anywhere (a chat, a note); the phone confirms it.

- `text` **(required)**: text (not empty). What is copied; may use ${field} placeholders, and a line whose placeholders all have no value is left out, such as "${title}\n${description}"
- `mapping`: text. Path of the part of the current data the text is filled in from
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `pdf`

Makes a PDF of saved objects, such as the ideas not done yet: a title, then each object's text as Markdown with its photos below. The share sheet opens on the PDF, to send, save or print it.

- `collection` **(required)**: text (not empty). The collection whose objects it shows
- `where`: an object. Only the objects whose fields have these values; values may use ${field} placeholders from the current data, such as { "appId": "${id}", "done": false }
- `sort`: a sort, `{ "by": "field" }` (see Order of a stored list), or a list of sorts. The order, as a stored list's sort
- `title`: text. The heading at the top and the file's name; may use ${field} placeholders from the current data. The app's name by default
- `text` **(required)**: text (not empty). Each object's part, as Markdown with ${field} placeholders from the object, such as "## ${title}\n${description}"; a line whose placeholders all have no value is left out
- `photos`: text. Path of each object's photos (a photos field's list) to show below its text
- `emptyText`: text. What an alert says when no object matches, instead of an empty PDF; may use ${field} placeholders
- `pageless`: `true` or `false`. true: one page as tall as everything, best read on a phone; false (default): A4 pages, for printing
- `mapping`: text. Path of the part of the current data to use
- `data`: an object with any data

#### `textpack`

Makes a TextPack of saved objects: one Markdown text (a title, then each object's text) with their photos as files beside it, zipped (textbundle.org), for notes apps and Markdown editors. The share sheet opens on it.

- `collection` **(required)**: text (not empty). The collection whose objects it shows
- `where`: an object. Only the objects whose fields have these values; values may use ${field} placeholders from the current data, such as { "appId": "${id}", "done": false }
- `sort`: a sort, `{ "by": "field" }` (see Order of a stored list), or a list of sorts. The order, as a stored list's sort
- `title`: text. The heading at the top and the pack's name; may use ${field} placeholders from the current data. The app's name by default
- `text` **(required)**: text (not empty). Each object's part, as Markdown with ${field} placeholders from the object, such as "## ${title}\n${description}"; a line whose placeholders all have no value is left out
- `photos`: text. Path of each object's photos (a photos field's list): kept ones go in the pack as files, linked below its text
- `emptyText`: text. What an alert says when no object matches, instead of an empty pack; may use ${field} placeholders
- `mapping`: text. Path of the part of the current data to use
- `data`: an object with any data

### Actions and references

Where an action is expected, write an action definition or `{ "ref": "id" }` referencing one in the root `actions`.

#### Action definition

- `id` **(required)**: text (not empty)
- `data`: an object with any data
- `type`: one of `"click"`, `"longclick"`
- `event` **(required)**: an event

#### REST data for a list (`initData`)

- `url` **(required)**: text (not empty)
- `method`: one of `"get"`, `"post"`, `"put"`, `"delete"`. get (default), post, put or delete; post and put send the current data as a JSON body
- `headers`: an object
- `thenDo`: an event
- `mapping`: text
- `data`: an object with any data
- `nextPage`: a value. How the list asks for more items when it nears its end. Either parameter and step: that query parameter (such as skip) grows by step, the page size, until a page has fewer items. Or urlFrom: the path in the response of the next page's URL, until there is none

#### Saved data for a list (`stored`)

The objects a save event put in a collection, oldest first; it shows them again when that collection changes.

- `collection` **(required)**: text (not empty). The collection's name, as in the save event
- `where`: an object. Only the objects whose fields have these values; values may use ${field} placeholders from the list's data, such as { "appId": "${id}" }
- `sort`: a sort, `{ "by": "field" }` (see Order of a stored list), or a list of sorts. The order: one sort, or a list where each later sort orders what the earlier ones leave tied (such as done last, then by priority)
- `sortOptions`: an array; each item is an object. Orders the user can choose, as a row of buttons above the list (the first until they choose); they replace sort. Keep titles short, such as Status, Priority, Newest
- `filterBy`: text. A field of tags (a tags field's list, or text with commas): the list offers a chip per tag in use, after All, to show only items with that tag
- `initialItems`: an array; each item is an object. Objects saved in the collection the first time the list opens, when nothing was ever saved there: a checklist to tick off (places to visit, things to pack), whose items update and delete then change like any saved object. Give each a key field and set unique so a later version's new items are added too
- `unique`: text. A field of initialItems that tells them apart, such as "key": each time the list opens, the initial items whose value there was never added are saved (a later version's new places); the ones already saved stay as the user left them, and deleted ones don't come back

#### Order of a stored list (`sort`)

By the field by; values listed in order come first, in that order (such as ["High", "Medium", "Low"]), then the others, numbers by size and text alphabetically. Objects without the field come last; ties keep the order they were saved in.

- `by` **(required)**: text (not empty). The field to sort by, such as "priority"
- `order`: an array; each item is text. Values in the order they come first, always as text, also for numbers and true/false (such as ["false", "true"])
- `descending`: `true` or `false`. Turns the order round

#### Size (`size`)

- `width`: a whole number (at least 0)
- `height`: a whole number (at least 0)

## Example 1: a checklist saved on the phone, with a detail screen

The list starts with its `initialItems`, saved once; `unique` adds the ones a later version brings. Ticking runs the `tick` update, and `sort` puts visited places last. Tapping an item shows the reusable `place` view.

## Example 2: a form with required fields and an alert

Submitting runs the form's action with the filled-in values, so the alert can use `${name}`.

## Example 3: a list loaded from a REST API, with a detail screen

`initData` loads the JSON; `mapping` selects its array; each item's fields fill the item view and the detail.

## Your task

Create an Appkin v3 configuration for this app: <describe the app: its screens, data and actions>

If you can create files, give me the complete configuration as a downloadable file named app.json, containing only the JSON. If you can't, reply with only the complete JSON, starting with { and ending with }: no comments or explanations. I will open your file or share your answer in the Appkin app, which runs it; if it reports problems, I will send them to you to fix.
